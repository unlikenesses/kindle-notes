It was on that date that the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 20 points, preparing the way for the ‘supply-side economics’ that would constitute the ‘economic reality’ in which we are now enmeshed.

Dutch East India Company. Formed out of a union of various smaller companies in 1602, the East India Company was the first of the enormous corporations that were to dominate the European overseas expansion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; in its first year of operation its gross income already exceeded the ordinary revenue of the English government, and (like the English East India Company a hundred years later) it sent out military forces as well as trading vessels in order to overawe its rivals and offer help to dissident groups all over the Far East. The De Groots were shareholders in the company and sat on the board of one of its “chambers” in Delft. The fact that one of the principal actors in international politics at the beginning of the seventeenth century was not a state but a private corporation was to be of enormous significance in the formation of Grotius’s political thought.

It is doubtful that the Renaissance would have that meaning were it not for Machiavelli. For modernity is not merely something new but also a new idea that favors innovation in principle and constantly promotes new ideas and institutions, a change that wants to be receptive to further change. Whatever is modern does not stay the same but keeps becoming more modern. Such are Machiavelli’s “new modes and orders” in the Discourses and his new prince in The Prince. Nothing like Machiavelli’s encouragement of innovation as such, topped off with the proud advertisement of his own originality, can be found in other writers of his time or before.

Because the reordering of a city for a political way of life presupposes a good man, and becoming prince of a republic by violence presupposes a bad man, one will find that it very rarely happens that someone good wishes to become prince by bad ways, even though his end be good, and that someone wicked, having become prince, wishes to work well, and that it will ever occur to his mind to use well the authority that he has acquired badly. No one could put better the moral contradiction at the heart of Machiavelli’s marriage of tyranny and republicanism. Nonetheless, he concludes that to create or maintain a republic in a corrupt city, it is necessary to turn it more toward a kingly state than toward a popular one.

Machiavelli’s apparent indifference to whether these good ends achieved through bad means result from good men willing to use bad means or from bad men willing to seek good ends, as if there were no effectual difference between them.

Leading it back toward the beginnings, Machiavelli explains, means restoring esteem for virtue through some terrifying external danger, through the virtue of a citizen who carries out “excessive and notable” executions that remind men of punishment and renew fear in their spirits, or alternatively through “the simple virtue of one man” who acts outside the law.

For the first time in the history of political philosophy, one finds a discussion not of the justice of conspiracy but of the ways and means. Instead of disputing whether it is just to conspire against a tyrant, Machiavelli shows how to conduct a conspiracy against either a republic or a tyranny; and, as if this were not enough, he shows governments how to conspire against peoples.

And when one’s subject matter is literature, clarity beyond a certain point becomes falsification. This is a very important restriction on the activity of literary criticism. When a subject matter is in its nature vague, clarity should consist, not in making it so clear as to be unrecognisable, but in recognising the vagueness, where it begins and ends and the causes of its necessity, and in checking analysis and division at the prudent point.

There are, as I tried to say in the first lecture, essentially two ways in which poetry can add to human experience. One is by perceiving and recording accurately the world—of both sense and feeling—as given at any moment; the other by extending the frontiers of this world.

For passion, unless it be of an astounding simplicity and ingenuity, or unless it be sustained by a high philosophy which interprets it into something else, must always fade out. In Donne it fades into the play of suggested ideas; and Donne is the great ruler of that borderland of fading and change.

It was an era when the political and cultural institutions of bourgeois liberalism were extended, or about to be extended, to the working masses living in bourgeois societies, including even (for the first time in history) its women, but the extension was at the cost of forcing its central class, the liberal bourgeoisie, on to the margins of political power. For the electoral democracies, which were the inevitable product of liberal progress, liquidated bourgeois liberalism as a political force in most countries.

The fact that Italy was at war, however, if not yet with the United States, put his willingness to be of use in a very different light, and Pound did indicate a readiness to join in on its side. But that did not mean ‘a divided allegiance’, he insisted, because what Italy was fighting for, in his special view of the war, was the same thing as an American loyal to the Constitution should fight for—their common enemy was the financial system which had undone the American republic and had undone the European democracies.

He might have added that it was altogether in the spirit of the American Revolution to distinguish between ‘acts against the government and acts against the oppressions of the government’. But Thomas Jefferson, who made that distinction, did so in the course of observing that it was one rarely respected, since ‘most codes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against one’s country’. That was the jeopardy Pound was placing himself in.

So building a model that starts with market clearing and allocation and then tries to fit in money as a veil on top of this makes little sense. As American economist Hyman Minsky argues: ...we cannot understand how our economy works by first solving allocation problems and then adding financing relations; in a capitalist economy resource allocation and price determination are integrated with the financing of outputs, positions in capital assets, and the validating of liabilities. This means that nominal values (money prices) matter: money is not neutral.

Neither does the orthodox story provide a satisfactory explanation of the existence of modern ‘fiat’ money – that is, money backed only by the authority of a sovereign (previously the King, now the state or central bank) rather than any commodity. The £10 banknote in your wallet or the £400 of digital money deposited in your bank account does not appear to be backed by any commodity. You cannot change it into gold or silver.

Furthermore the 1844 Act did not incorporate demand deposits as part of its legislation as it would be very difficult for any customer or state regulator to be able to tell the difference between a fictitious demand deposit, created by the banks when they issue a loan, and a ‘real’ demand deposit placed at a bank by a customer who, for example, has just received their salary. Both types of money will look exactly the same in the banks accounting reports.

It has also been suggested that inter-war instability was in part a result of the shift of power from the pre-war dominance of sterling to the new global reserve currency – the US dollar – and hence the de facto governance of the global financial system passing to the US Federal Reserve, which was unaccustomed to and ill-prepared for such an undertaking.

However, when defining money mainly as private sector assets, there is no sharp dividing line between money and non-money. There are some assets which can be much more easily converted into money than others; this quality is referred to as liquidity. More liquid assets are those that can be more certainly realisable at short notice without loss.

For example, my house is very illiquid because I am unlikely to be able to sell it quickly unless perhaps I offer it for sale at a huge discount. In contrast, if I can find a pawnbroker then I can quickly convert my watch into cash. If other people realise that my watch is quite a liquid asset, they might even accept it in exchange for selling me something, because they know they can easily convert it into cash. In this case, my watch has taken on some of the functions of money – we might call this ‘near-money’.

during the 1970s, a fundamental shift occurred in the way the Bank of England conducted monetary policy. As new kinds of financial institutions – secondary banks (see section 3.6.3) – began lending aggressively, the Bank decided that rather than try to regulate the quantity of credit provided by the banking system as a whole, it would attempt to influence the price of credit.

In this situation, creating money in the form of deposits through making loans will not help the bank at all. This is because making loans increases the assets (the loan contract) and the liabilities (the newly-created deposits) by exactly equal amounts, but does not affect the net difference between assets and liabilities.

In 1909, the British journalist Norman Angell, then Paris editor of the French edition of the Daily Mail, published a pamphlet entitled Europe’s Optical Illusion. The thesis of his slim volume was that the economic benefits of war were so illusory—hence the title—and the commercial and financial linkages between countries now so extensive that no rational country should contemplate starting a war. The economic chaos, especially the disruptions to international credit, that would ensue from a war among the Great Powers would harm all sides and the victor would lose as much as the vanquished.

To pay for such a gigantic effort by taxation alone would have entailed tax rates at confiscatory levels and was therefore impossible. Daunted by the task, none of the governments even tried, and taxes accounted for but a tiny fraction of the new money raised. Instead, the belligerents resorted principally to borrowing. Once they had exhausted every potential source of loans, they relied on a technique almost as old as war itself: inflation.

Der Würzburger Zimmerer sollte nach einer Polizeiverordnung vom Jahre 1387, die sicherlich nicht unterschritten, eher überschritten wurde, einen Tageslohn im Gegenwert von etwa 26 kg Roggen erhalten. Das bedeutet je Konsumtag bei zwei arbeitsfreien Tagen in der Woche 18,6 kg Roggenäquivalente. Der Berliner Maurer erhielt je Arbeitstag, der nunmehr mit dem Konsumtag gleichgesetzt werden soll, den Gegenwert von 6,7 kg Roggen«

Immer stärker nutzten die Verleger die Abhängigkeit der Beschäftigten aus, um die Preise der aufgekauften Waren zu drücken. Auf diese Weise waren die Heimarbeiter gezwungen, immer schneller zu arbeiten, ihren Arbeitstag immer weiter auszudehnen und selbst die Kinder mitarbeiten zu lassen.

Viele berühmte Potentaten aus dem Pantheon der heraufdämmernden europäischen Moderne wie der nahezu analphabetische französische »Sonnenkönig« Ludwig XIV. oder der Preußenherrscher Friedrich »der Große« waren in Wirklichkeit räuberische Menschenverächter, gewissermaßen vom Schlage eines Idi Amin oder eines Saddam Hussein unserer Tage.

Jeder absolutistische Staat versuchte, so viel wie möglich zu exportieren und so wenig wie möglich zu importieren, um durch eine »positive Handelsbilanz« (damals ein völlig neuer Begriff der eben erst entstehenden theoretischen Nationalökonomie) den größten Geldreichtum auf das eigene Land zu ziehen und für Staatszwecke zu verpulvern. Das war die Doktrin des »Merkantilismus«, einer Ideologie des Außenhandels, eines »Exportismus« - und damit das erste »wirtschaftspolitische« Konzept der Geschichte, das damals auf die Bedürfnisse der frühmodernen Militärstaaten zugeschnitten war.

Mit allen Mitteln, natürlich auch denen der politischen und militärischen Pression, versuchten die absolutistischen Regimes, sich selber einerseits durch Zollschranken abzuschirmen, andererseits aber den eigenen Export auf Teufel komm raus zu forcieren.

So konnte nicht die Kaufkraft der Massen an sich das Ziel sein, und nicht deswegen ein innerer nationaler Markt entstehen. Die Masse der Produzenten war und galt nur als das Menschenmaterial, die »abstrakte Gesamtarbeitskraft« des jeweiligen Staates, die im Wirtschaftskrieg um den abstrakten Geldreichtum in die Waagschale zu werfen war. Die Menschen sollten nicht gut leben und konsumieren, sondern ihr Leben für die absolutistischen Zwecke verwursten lassen.

Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.

"Civilization's going to pieces," broke out Tom violently. "I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?" "Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his tone. "Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."
